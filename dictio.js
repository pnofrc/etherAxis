    'You’re about to make contact with the realm of the sensor. Information excites us. Lots of it. With lights and sounds and smells and vibrations and words and feelings and explosions of nuances. But information also means power, which means responsibility. Information can be subtle, it doesn’t always choose to present itself in a decrypted way, so you need to become hyper aware and keep adapting yourself. Once you become one with the endless flows of information, you become fluid. It’s the ultimate goal, as transformation is the only constant in the emerging state of turbulence. Welcome aboard, what’s your preferred destination?',
    'You’re about to make contact with the realm of the synchroniser. We like to feel the streams of energy through the movements of our physical being. Once you really learn to pay attention to the flow, you can feel the air bubbles in your blood rising from the bottom of your being to the ends of your limbs, and circling back into the earth. Not only this, but you’d feel the flow in others too. It’s exciting, isn’t it? As together, we are one flock. We’re a swarm. All moving in different paths but heading in the same direction. As we move our bodies and you move your bodies, we transmit the information that mind and matter hold. How about you give it a try? When you really concentrate, can you feel the vibration in your fingertips?',
    'You’re about to make contact with the realm of the energizer. Imagine yourself on a train. Or any kind of transportation method with a view. Actually, imagine yourself being the train, the view is better that way. The tracks lead far into the unknown. You just keep going and have endless energy, while the sun goes up and down and up and down as you travel through light and darkness. It’s the constant change that keeps you going. You move so quick that the wind hurts your skin, but the speed is the only thing you have left. If you’d slow down or stop you would be blown away, so you just keep going and embrace the terrains of the unknown. You move so quick that outsiders in the Ether can’t even see the edges of your physical being. That’s us. We’re beams of light, constantly moving, adding to the knowledge streams while bypassing the hurdles of stagnation.',
    'You’re about to make contact with the realm of the transmitter. Any being emits knowledge. It’s in the flow of the water, the thoughts of minds, migrations of bodies. Within the interconnectedness of energy streams there is no knowledge unknown. It’s vast and endless, really. We know how to connect our multiple bodies to that stream. Imagine an ant nest or beehive and how the individual bodies communicate with each other. Together they form one. We are not the beehive. Together, we are only a singular bee, responding to the other interconnected beings in the Ether. It’s only through making kin and adding new layers we get to overcome the changing of times.',
    'Sensor! Sychronizer! Energizer! Transmitter! You have unlocked the four bridge points and are now able to reach the liminal space of EtherAxis! Return to the table, quick!'

    'Hello Sensor. The tradesman at this shop is a special one. Not only does he trade in otherworldly substances for the human world, by temporary transcendence we receive information from him too. We become one with it. The substance you’ve requested is apparently not available in stock. He tries to sell you fake crystals. You know this, but you also see that his security staff way outnumbers that of your group. How do you respond? Remember your skills and nature.',
    'Hello Sychroniser. How did it make you feel? To move with us, and just like us. I could feel you. I felt you shaking, but just a little bit. Like a single drop of water falling into a larger body of its liquid. Empty spaces in the human world like here are great for us, because the vibrations of energy that travel through these walls and tiles are less distracted by passing figures. It’s important that enough of these locations remain because we need them to sense the essential changes in the Ether. This one here is actually one of our favourites, and it is in danger for it might be destroyed. You can feel the frustration in the people around you. What will you do? Remember your skills and nature.',
    'Welcome Energizer. They are as resourceful as emotional, the array of messages we receive on our ongoing journeys. But your message must be one of our favourites. The messages we receive kind of sound like the waves you are hearing right now. We know you’re a bit scared but don’t worry, we are too. It is what makes us strong. As you move on to the next location, you suddenly see a small path that leads away from the main road. You’re actually in a hurry, but maybe this route could be quicker and gosh the fragrance that penetrates your nose is beautifully strong. It’s like your body is drawn to it, but maybe it’s just distraction or your body is tired. What do you do? Remember your skills and nature.',
    'Welcome transmitter, you are my personal favourite. The interconnectedness of all beings is what binds the alternate realities of the Ether together. Without our knowledge there would only be chaos. Without knowledge of transformation, we wouldn’t know how to adapt to it. There is something that binds all of your journeys together. There is something in the shapes of your movements and flows of energy creating a pattern. It’s as if a new kind of language formed a secret code, you just do not know how to read it yet. What do you do? Remember your skills and nature.',
    'Will you follow the lightbeam on the horizon or will you turn and run to the woods?',

    'Sensor! The bridge point to your realm is hidden in a see of lights, people seek it to change their perception. In between flashing lights of many colours, you see a rotating text in a window display. What is the word that is written on it?',
    'Sychronizer! Follow the metal fence alongside the contruction site. Right at its end, you see a red and white barrier. Go beyond it and around the building to reach the bridge point. Do you see the two yellow poles in front of the garage doors? Dare to lift the metal to its feet to pull out a little camouflaged container. The codeword is inside. Put it back as you found it after.',
    'Energizer! The bridge point to your realm is protected by a hooded creature standing in wet matter. Close by, you will find a black metal fence. The codeword is inside a tiny magnetic capsule next to one of its screws. Put it back as you found it after.',
    'Transmitter! The bridge point to your realm is centered around a big tree on a crossing. At its feet, there is a luscious polypore fungus. Draw a line from this tree to the closest fence in your mind. This is where you will find a tiny magnetic container hidden next to a screw. The codeword is inside. Put it back as you found it after.',
